You left with no goodbye. Not a single word was said, No final kiss to seal any sins. I had no idea of the state we were in.

Baby, please remember me once more.  When was the last time you thought of me? Or have you completely erased me from your memory? I often think about where I went wrong. The more I do, the less I know.  But I know I have a fickle heart and a bitterness, And a wandering eye, and a heaviness in my head.  But don't you remember, Don't you remember The reason you loved me before? Baby, please remember me once more.  Gave you the space so you could breathe, I kept my distance so you would be free, And hoped that you'd find the missing piece To bring you back to me.

I set fire to the rain And I threw us into the flames When it fell, something died 'Cause I knew that that was the last time, the last time!  Sometimes I wake up by the door That heart you caught must be waiting for you Even now, when we're already over I can't help myself from looking for you  I set fire to the rain Watched it pour as I touched your face Well, it burned while I cried 'Cause I heard it screaming out your name, your name  I set fire to the rain And I threw us into the flames When it fell, something died 'Cause I knew that that was the last time, the last time, oh!

I'm willing to take the risk  I won't go I can't do it on my own If this ain't love, then what is? I'm willing to take the risk  Will he... will he still remember me? Will he still love me even when he's free? Or will he go back to the place where he would choose the poison over me?  When we spoke yesterday He said to hold my breath and sit and wait "I'll be home so soon, I won't be late."  He won't go He can't do it on his own If this ain't love, then what is? He's willing to take the risk  So I won't go He can't do it on his own If this ain't love, then what is? I'm willing to take the risk  'Cause he won't go He can't do it on his own If this ain't love, then what is?

It's beginning to look a lot like Christmas; Soon the bells will start, And the thing that will make them ring is the carol that you sing Right within your heart  It's beginning to look a lot like Christmas Toys in every store But the prettiest sight to see is the holly that will be On your own front door.  Sure it's Christmas once more...   ###############################################  You better watch out You better not cry You better not pout I'm telling you why Santa Claus is coming to town  He's making a list He's checking it twice; He's gonna find out who's naughty or nice Santa Claus is coming to town  He sees you when you're sleeping And he knows when you're awake He knows if you've been bad or good So be good for goodness sake!

It's like a kaleidoscope of memories. It just all comes back. But he never does. I think part of me knew the second I saw him that this would happen. It's not really anything he said or anything he did, It was the feeling that came along with it. And the crazy thing is I don't know if I'm ever gonna feel that way again. But I don't know if I should. I knew his world moved too fast and burned too bright. But I just thought, how can the devil be pulling you toward someone who looks so much like an angel when he smiles at you? Maybe he knew that when he saw me. I guess I just lost my balance. I think that the worst part of it all wasn't losing him. It was losing me.  Once upon a time, a few mistakes ago I was in your sights, you got me alone You found me, you found me, you found me I guess you didn't care, and I guess I liked that And when I fell hard you took a step back Without me, without me, without me  And he's long gone when he's next to me And I realize the blame is on me  'Cause I knew you were trouble when you walked in So shame on me now Flew me to places I'd never been 'Til you put me down, oh I knew you were trouble when you walked in So shame on me now Flew me to places I'd never been Now I'm lying on the cold hard ground Oh, oh, trouble, trouble, trouble Oh, oh, trouble, trouble, trouble  No apologies.

It feels like a perfect night for breakfast at midnight To fall in love with strangers, uh uh, uh uh.  Yeah, We're happy, free, confused, and lonely at the same time It's miserable and magical. Oh, yeah Tonight's the night when we forget about the deadlines It's time  Uh oh!

Too many cool kids, uh uh, uh uh (who's Taylor Swift anyway, ew?) It seems like one of those nights, We ditch the whole scene and end up dreaming Instead of sleeping.  Yeah, We're happy, free, confused, and lonely in the best way It's miserable and magical. Oh, yeah Tonight's the night when we forget about the heartbreaks It's time  Uh oh! (hey!)

I bet you're tired from a long hard week. I bet you're sitting in your chair by the window looking out at the city. And I bet sometimes you wonder about me.  And I just wanna tell you It takes everything in me not to call you. And I wish I could run to you. And I hope you know that every time I don't I almost do, I almost do.  I bet you think I either moved on or hate you 'Cause each time you reach out there's no reply. I bet it never ever occurred to you that I can't say "Hello" to you And risk another goodbye.

And I hope sometimes you wonder about me.   ###############################################  I remember when we broke up the first time Saying, "This is it, I've had enough," 'cause like We hadn't seen each other in a month When you said you needed space. (What?) Then you come around again and say "Baby, I miss you and I swear I'm gonna change, trust me." Remember how that lasted for a day? I say, "I hate you," we break up, you call me, "I love you."  Ooh, we called it off again last night But ooh, this time I'm telling you, I'm telling you  We are never ever ever getting back together, We are never ever ever getting back together, You go talk to your friends, talk to my friends, talk to me But we are never ever ever ever getting back together  Like, ever...  I'm really gonna miss you picking fights And me falling for it screaming that I'm right And you would hide away and find your peace of mind With some indie record that's much cooler than mine  Ooh, you called me up again tonight But ooh, this time I'm telling you, I'm telling you  We are never, ever, ever getting back together We are never, ever, ever getting back together You go talk to your friends, talk to my friends, talk to me (talk to me) But we are never ever ever ever getting back together  Ooh, yeah, ooh yeah, ooh yeah Oh oh oh  I used to think that we were forever ever And I used to say, "Never say never..." Uggg... so he calls me up and he's like, "I still love you," And I'm like... "I just... I mean this is exhausting, you know, like, We are never getting back together. Like, ever"  No!  We are never ever ever getting back together We are never ever ever getting back together You go talk to your friends, talk to my friends, talk to me But we are never ever ever ever getting back together  We, ooh, getting back together, ohhh, We, ooh, getting back together  You go talk to your friends, talk to my friends, talk to me (talk to me) But we are never ever ever ever getting back together   ###############################################  I'm pretty sure we almost broke up last night. I threw my phone across the room at you. I was expecting some dramatic turn-away, But you stayed.  This morning I said we should talk about it. 'Cause I read you should never leave a fight unresolved. That's when you came in wearing a football helmet and said, "Okay, let's talk."  And I said, Stay, stay, stay. I've been lovin' you for quite some time, time, time. You think that it's funny when I'm mad, mad, mad. But I think that it's best if we both stay.  Before you I'd only dated self-indulgent takers, Who took all of their problems out on me. But you carry my groceries, and now I'm always laughin'. And I love you because you have given me no choice but to...  Stay, stay, stay. I've been lovin' you for quite some time, time, time. You think that it's funny when I'm mad, mad, mad. But I think that it's best if we both stay, stay, stay, stay.  You took the time to memorize me: My fears, my hopes, and dreams. I just like hangin' out with you all the time. All those times that you didn't leave; It's been occurring to me I'd like to hang out with you for my whole life.  Stay. And I'll be loving you for quite some time. No one else is gonna love me, when I get mad, mad, mad. So I think that it's best if we both stay, stay, stay, stay, stay, stay.  Stay, stay, stay. I've been lovin' you for quite some time, time, time. You think that it's funny when I'm mad, mad, mad. But I think that it's best if we both stay, stay, stay, stay, stay, stay.  Stay, stay, stay. I've been lovin' you for quite some time, time, time. You think that it's funny when I'm mad, mad, mad. But I think that it's best if we both stay.  ###############################################  I find myself at your door Just like all those times before I'm not sure how I got there All roads—they lead me here  I imagine you are home In your room, all alone And you open your eyes into mine And everything feels better  And right before your eyes I'm breaking, no past No reasons why Just you and me  This is the last time I'm asking you this Put my name at the top of your list This is the last time I'm asking you why You break my heart in the blink of an eye, eye, eye  You find yourself at my door Just like all those times before You wear your best apology But I was there to watch you leave  And all the times I let you in Just for you to go again Disappear when you come back Everything is better  And right before your eyes I'm aching, no past Nowhere to hide Just you and me  This is the last time I'm asking you this Put my name at the top of your list This is the last time I'm asking you why You break my heart in the blink of an eye, eye, eye  This is the last time you tell me I've got it wrong This is the last time I say it's been you all along This is the last time I let you in my door This is the last time, I won't hurt you anymore  Oh, oh, oh  This is the last time I'm asking you this Put my name at the top of your list This is the last time I'm asking you why You break my heart in the blink of an eye  This is the last time I'm asking you Last time I'm asking you Last time I'm asking you this This is the last time I'm asking you Last time I'm asking you Last time I'm asking you this This is the last time I'm asking you Last time I'm asking you Last time I'm asking you this This is the last time I'm asking you Last time I'm asking you Last time I'm asking you this   ###############################################  I was reminiscing just the other day, While having coffee all alone and Lord, it took me away. Back to a first-glance feeling on New York Time. Back when you fit in my poems like a perfect rhyme. Took off faster than a green light "Go". Yeah, you skipped the conversation when you already know. I left a note on the door with a joke we’d made, And that was the first day.  And darling, it was good never looking down. And right there where we stood was holy ground.  Spinning like a girl in a brand new dress, We had this big wide city all to ourselves. We blocked the noise with the sound of ‘I need you’, And for the first time I had something to lose, And I guess we fell apart in the usual way. And the story’s got dust on every page, But sometimes I wonder how you think about it now. And I see your face in every crowd.  Cause darling, it was good never looking down. And right there where we stood was holy ground.  Tonight I’m gonna dance for all that we’ve been through. But I don’t wanna dance if I’m not dancing with you. Tonight I’m gonna dance like you were in this room. But I don’t wanna dance if I’m not dancing with you,  It was good never looking down. And right there where we stood was holy ground.  Tonight I’m gonna dance for all that we’ve been through. But I don’t wanna dance if I’m not dancing with you. Tonight I’m gonna dance like you were in this room. But I don’t wanna dance if I’m not dancing with you.   ###############################################  Long handwritten note deep in your pocket Words, how little they mean when you're a little too late I stood right by the tracks, your face in a locket Good girls, hopeful they'll be and long they will wait  We had a beautiful magic love there What a sad beautiful tragic love affair  In dreams I meet you in warm conversation We both wake in lonely beds, different cities And time is taking its sweet time erasing you And you've got your demons, and, darling, they all look like me  'Cause we had a beautiful magic love there What a sad beautiful tragic love affair  Distance, timing, breakdown, fighting Silence, the train runs off its tracks Kiss me, try to fix it, could you just try to listen? Hang up, give up and for the life of us we can't get back  A beautiful magic love there What a sad beautiful tragic, beautiful tragic, beautiful  And we had a beautiful magic love there What a sad beautiful tragic love affair  We had a beautiful magic love there What a sad beautiful tragic love affair   New to town with a made up name in the angel's city, Chasing fortune and fame. And the camera flashes, make it look like a dream.  You had it figured out since you were in school. Everybody loves pretty, everybody loves cool. So overnight you look like a sixties’ queen.  Another name goes up in lights, like diamonds in the sky.  And they’ll tell you now, you’re the lucky one. Yeah, they’ll tell you now, you’re the lucky one. But can you tell me now, you’re the lucky one, oh, oh, oh...  Now it’s big black cars, and Riviera views, And your lover in the foyer doesn't even know you And your secrets end up splashed on the news front page.  And they tell you that you’re lucky. But you’re so confused, 'Cause you don’t feel pretty, you just feel used. And all the young things line up to take your place.  Another name goes up in lights. You wonder if you’ll make it out alive.  And they’ll tell you now, you’re the lucky one. Yeah, they’ll tell you now, you’re the lucky one. Can you tell me now, you’re the lucky one, oh, oh, oh.  It was a few years later, I showed up here. And they still tell the legend of how you disappeared, How you took the money and your dignity, and got the hell out. They say you bought a bunch of land somewhere, Chose the Rose Garden over Madison Square, And it took some time, but I understand it now.  ‘Cause now my name is up in lights, but I think you got it right,  Let me tell you now, you’re the lucky one.

rhythm show me the way No one can find us here, fade out and disappear  If my red eyes don't see you anymore And I can't hear you through the white noise  Just send your heartbeat I'll go to the blue

And I can't wait to see, what my buddies all think of me Just imagine how much cooler I'll be in summerrrrrr  Da da, da doo, ah bah bah bah bah bah boo The hot and the cold are both so intense Put'em together - it just makes sense!  Ratdadat dad dada doo Winter's a good time to stay in and cuddle But put me in summer and I'll be a - happy snowman!  When life gets rough, I like to hold on to my dream Relaxing in the summer sun, just lettin' off steam Oh the sky would be blue, and you guys'll be there too When I finally do what frozen things do in summerrrrrrr  I'm gonna' tell him - Don't you dare!  In summerrrrrrrrr!  ###############################################  Please don't shut me out again, Please don't slam the door You don't have to keep your distance anymore  'Cuz for the first time in forever, I finally understand For the first time in forever, We can fix this hand in hand  We can head down this mountain together You don't have live in fear 'Cuz for the first time in forever, I will be right here  Please go back home, your life awaits Go enjoy the sun and open up the gates  You mean well, but leave me be Yes, I'm alone, but I'm alone and free Just stay away and you'll be safe from me  Actually we're not  (What do you mean you're not?) I get the feeling you don't know  (What do I not know?) Arendelle's in deep, deep, deep, deep snow  'Cuz for the first time in forever,  (I'm such a fool, I can't be free) You don't have to be afraid  (No escape from the storm inside of me) We can work this out together  (I can't control the curse) We'll reverse the storm you've made  (Anna, please! You'll only make it worse!)  Don't panic  (There's so much fear) We'll make the sun shine bright  (You're not safe here) We can face this thing together  (No!) We can change this winter weather And everything we'll be (I can't!)  ###############################################  What's the issue, dear? Why are you holding back from such a man? Is it the clumpy way he walks? Or the grumpy way he talks? Or the pear-shaped, square-shaped Weirdness of his feet?  And though we know he washes Well, he always ends up sort of smelly.  But you'll never meet a fellow who's as Sensitive and sweet! So he's a bit of a fixer-upper, So he's got a few flaws.  Like his peculiar brain dear, His thing with the reindeer. That's a little outside of nature's laws!  So he's a bit of a fixer-upper, but this we're certain of You can fix this fixer-upper Up with a little bit of love!  Can we please just Stop talking about this? We've got a real, actual problem here.  I'll say! So tell me, dear Is it the way that he runs scared? Or that he's socially impaired? Or that he only likes to tinkle in the woods - what?!  Are you holding back your Fondness due to his unmanly blondness?  Or the way he covers Up that he's the honest goods?  He's just a bit of a fixer-upper, He's got a couple of bugs His isolation is confirmation Of his desperation for human hugs So he's a bit of a fixer-upper, But we know what to do The way to fix up this fixer-upper Is to fix him up with you!  So she's a bit of a fixer-upper, Her brain's a bit betwixt. Get the fianc? out of the way and The whole thing will be fixed.  We're not sayin' you can change him, 'Cause people don't really change. We're only saying that love's a force That's powerful and strange. People make bad choices if they're mad, Or scared, or stressed. Throw a little love their way. Throw a little love their way. And you'll bring out their best.  True love brings out their best! Everyone's a bit of a fixer-upper, That's what it's all about!  Father! Sister! Brother!  We need each other to raise Us up and round us out. Everyone's a bit of a fixer-upper, But when push comes to shove.  The only fixer-upper fixer That can fix up a fixer-upper is  True! true! True, true, true! Love (True love) Love, love, love, love, love Love! (True love!)  ###############################################  Let it go, let it go Can't hold it back anymore Let it go, let it go Turn my back and slam the door  The snow glows white on the mountain tonight, Not a footprint to be seen. A kingdom of isolation and it looks like I'm the queen. The wind is howling like the swirling storm inside. Couldn't keep it in, heaven knows I tried.  Don't let them in, don't let them see, Be the good girl you always had to be. Conceal, don't feel, don't let them know. Well now they know.  Let it go, let it go Can't hold it back anymore Let it go, let it go Turn my back and slam the door And here I stand and here I'll stay Let it go, let it go The cold never bothered me anyway  It's funny how some distance makes everything seem small And the fears that once controlled me can't get to me at all. Up here in the cold thin air I finally can breathe. I know I left a life behind but I'm too relieved to grieve.  Let it go, let it go Can't hold it back anymore Let it go, let it go Turn my back and slam the door And here I stand, and here I'll stay Let it go, let it go The cold never bothered me anyway  Standing frozen In the life I've chosen. You won't find me. The past is all behind me Buried in the snow.  Let it go, let it go Can't hold it back anymore Let it go, let it go Turn my back and slam the door And here I stand, and here I'll stay Let it go, let it go The cold never bothered me anyway, yeah, whoa (Na na, na na, na na na na) Let it go Na, na. Here I stand. Let it go, let it go, oh Let it go.  ############################################### Walking through a crowd The village is aglow Kaleidoscope of loud Heartbeats under coats Everybody here Wanted something more Searching for a sound we hadn't Heard before And it said  Welcome to New York It's been waiting for you Welcome to New York Welcome to New York Welcome to New York It's been waiting for you Welcome to New York Welcome to New York  It's a new soundtrack I could dance to this beat, beat Forevermore The lights are so bright But they never blind me, me Welcome to New York It's been waiting for you Welcome to New York Welcome to New York  When we first dropped our bags on Apartment floors Took our broken hearts Put them in a drawer Everybody here was someone else Before And you can want who you want Boys and boys and Girls and girls  Welcome to New York It's been waiting for you Welcome to New York Welcome to New York Welcome to New York It's been waiting for you Welcome to New York Welcome to New York  It's a new soundtrack I could dance to this beat, beat Forevermore The lights are so bright But they never blind me, me Welcome to New York (New York) It's been waiting for you Welcome to New York Welcome to New York  Like any great love it keeps you Guessing Like any real love It's ever changing Like any true love  It drives you crazy But you know you wouldn't Change anything anything Anything  Welcome to New York It's been waiting for you Welcome to New York Welcome to New York Welcome to New York It's been waiting for you Welcome to New York Welcome to New York  It's a new soundtrack I could dance to this beat The lights are so bright But they never blind me Welcome to New York New soundtrack It's been waiting for you Welcome to New York The lights are so bright But they never blind me Welcome to New York So bright They never blind me Welcome to New York Welcome to New York   ###############################################  Nice to meet you, where you been?

Then she handed me a bottle of water filled with tequila. I already know she's a keeper Just from this one small act of kindness, I'm in deep shit if anybody finds out I'm meant to drive home but I've drunk all of it now, not Sobering up we just sit on the couch One thing led to another Now she's kissing my mouth  I need you darling Come on set the tone If you feel you're falling Won't you let me know  Oh-oh-oh-oh-ooh Oh-oh-oh-oh-ooh  If you love me Come on, get involved Feel it rushing through you From your head to toe  Oh-oh-oh-oh-ooh Oh-oh-oh-oh-ooh  Sing!

I told her I'm not really looking for another mistake I called an old friend thinking that the trouble would wait But then I jump right in A week later returned I reckon she was only looking for a lover to burn But I gave her my time for two or three nights Then I put it on pause until the moment was right I went away for months until our paths crossed again She told me, "I was never looking for a friend. Maybe you could swing by my room around 10:00. Baby, bring a lemon and a bottle of gin. We'll be in between the sheets 'til the late AM. Baby, if you wanted me then you should've just said." She's singing Ah lahmlahlah  Don't fuck with my love That heart is so cold All over my home I don't wanna know that babe Ah lahmlahlah Don't fuck with my love I told her she knows Take aim and reload I don't wanna know that babe Ah lahmlahlah  And for a couple weeks I only wanna see her We drink away the days with a take-away pizza Before a text message was the only way to reach her Now she's staying at my place and loves the way I treat her Singing out Aretha All over the track like a feature And never wants to sleep, I guess that I don't want to either But me and her we make money the same way Four cities, two planes the same day And those shows have never been what it's about But maybe we'll go together and just figure it out I'd rather put on a film with you and sit on a couch But we should get on a plane Or we'll be missing it now Wish I'd have written it down The way that things played out When she was kissing him How I was confused about Now she should figure it out while I'm sat here singing Ah lahmlahlah  Don't fuck with my love That heart is so cold All over my home I don't wanna know that babe Ah lahmlahlah Don't fuck with my love I told her she knows Take aim and reload I don't wanna know that babe Ah lahmlahlah  Knock knock knock on my hotel door I don't even know if she knows what for She was crying on my shoulder I already told ya Trust and respect is what we do this for I never intended to be next But you didn't need to take him to bed that's all And I never saw him as a threat Until you disappeared with him to have sex of course It's not like we were both on tour We were staying on the same fucking hotel floor And I wasn't looking for a promise or commitment But it was never just fun and I thought you were different This is not the way you realize what you wanted It's a bit too much, too late if I'm honest And all this time God knows I'm singing Ah lahmlahlah  Don't fuck with my love That heart is so cold All over my home I don't wanna know that babe Ah lahmlahlah Don't fuck with my love I told her she knows Take aim and reload I don't wanna know that babe Ah lahmlahlah   ###############################################  I met you when I was a teen But then you were one as well And I could play a guitar Just like ringing a bell Sometimes I wonder In any other summer Could you have been my part-time lover to me Listening to Stevie Wonder Under the covers where we used to lay And Re: Stacks is what the speakers played I'd be on tour almost every day When I was home up in my flat is where we used to stay  Just watching a DVD, smoking illegal weed Getting high as two kites when we needed to breathe We used each other's air just for the people to see And stay up all night like when we needed to sleep We'd go anywhere our minds would take us And I'll say you are beautiful without your make-up And you don't even need to worry about your weight 'cause We can all be loved the way that God made us And time's the only reason that we could break up 'Cause you would always tell me I'm away too much Distance is relative to the time that it takes to get on a plane or make a mistake So say it again  Oh Nina, you should go Nina 'Cause I ain't ever coming home Nina Oh won't you leave me now And I've been livin' on the road Nina But then again you should know Nina 'Cause that's you and me both Nina Oh won't you leave me now, now  And every weekend in the winter you'd be wearing my hoodie With drawstrings pulled tight to keep your face from the cold Taking day trips to the local where we'd eat on our own 'Cause every day when I was away we'd only speak on the phone Watching Blue Planet, creating new habits Acting as if we were two rabbits And then you'd vanish Back to the borough with all the Celtics I disappear, you call me selfish I understand but I can't help it I put my job over everything except my family and friends But you'll be in between forever so I guess we'll have to take a step back Overlook the situation 'cause mixing business and feelings will only lead to complications And I'm not saying we should be taking a break Just re-evaluate quick before we make a mistake and it's too late So we can either deal with the pain or wait to get on a plane But in a day we'll have to say it again  Oh Nina, you should go Nina 'Cause I ain't ever coming home Nina Oh won't you leave me now And I've been livin' on the road Nina But then again you should know Nina 'Cause that's you and me both Nina Oh won't you leave me now, now  Love will come and love will go But you can make it on your own Sing that song Go oh won't you leave me now People grow and fall apart But you can mend your broken heart Take it back go oh won't you leave me now  Oh Nina, you should go Nina (Love will come and love will go) Cause I ain't ever coming home Nina (But you can make it on your own) Oh won't you leave me now (Sing that song, go oh won't you leave me now) And I've been livin' on the road Nina (People grow and fall apart) But then again you should know Nina (But you can mend your broken heart) Cause that's you and me both Nina (Take it back, go oh won't you leave me now) Oh won't you leave me now now   ###############################################  Loving can hurt Loving can hurt sometimes But it's the only thing that I know When it gets hard You know it can get hard sometimes It is the only thing that makes us feel alive  We keep this love in a photograph We made these memories for ourselves Where our eyes are never closing Hearts are never broken Times forever frozen still  So you can keep me Inside the pocket Of your ripped jeans Holding me closer 'Til our eyes meet You won't ever be alone Wait for me to come home  Loving can heal Loving can mend your soul And it's the only thing that I know (know) I swear it will get easier Remember that with every piece of ya And it's the only thing we take with us when we die  We keep this love in a photograph We made these memories for ourselves Where our eyes are never closing Hearts were never broken Times forever frozen still  So you can keep me Inside the pocket Of your ripped jeans Holding me closer 'Til our eyes meet You won't ever be alone  And if you hurt me That's OK, baby, only words bleed Inside these pages you just hold me And I won't ever let you go  Wait for me to come home Wait for me to come home Wait for me to come home Wait for me to come home  Oh you can fit me Inside the necklace you got when you were sixteen Next to your heartbeat Where I should be Keep it deep within your soul  And if you hurt me Well, that's OK, baby, only words bleed Inside these pages you just hold me And I won't ever let you go  When I'm away I will remember how you kissed me Under the lamppost Back on 6th street Hearing you whisper through the phone "Wait for me to come home"   ###############################################  I've been spinning now for time Couple women by my side I got sinning on my

run I let my heart decide the way When I was young Deep down I must have always known That this would be inevitable To earn my stripes I'd have to pay And bare my soul  I know I'm not the only one Who regrets the things they've done Sometimes I just feel it's only me Who can't stand the reflection that they see I wish I could live a little more Look up to the sky not just the floor I feel like my life is flashing by And all I can do is watch and cry I miss the air, I miss my friends I miss my mother, I miss it when Life was a party to be thrown But that was a million years ago  When I walk around all of the streets Where I grew up and found my feet They can't look me in the eye It's like they're scared of me I try to think of things to say Like a joke or a memory But they don't recognise me now In the light of day  I know I'm not the only one Who regrets the things they've done Sometimes I just feel it's only me Who never became who they thought they'd be I wish I could live a little more Look up to the sky not just the floor I feel like my life is flashing by And all I can do is watch and cry I miss the air, I miss my friends I miss my mother, I miss it when Life was a party to be thrown But that was a million years ago A million years ago   ###############################################  I will leave my heart at the door I won't say a word They've all been said

You know you're trying to be the best you can be,  but that's all you can do.  If you don't give it all you got, you're only cheating yourself. Give it all you got but if it ends up happening, it ends up happening.  That's what happening with me, it's like "God, I'm giving it all I've got,  sometimes I'm weak and I'm going to do it."  And it's like I'm not giving myself grace,  I'm just like understanding that's how it is.  ############################################### Tonight I just want to take you higher Throw your hands up in the sky Let's set this party off right  Players, put yo' pinky rings up to the moon Girls, what y'all trying to do? 24 karat magic in the air Head to toe so player Uh, look out!

The type of shit'll make me flip out And just kill somethin', drill somethin' Get ill and fill ratchets with a lil' somethin' I practiced runnin' from fear, guess I had some good luck At 27 years old, my biggest fear was bein' judged How they look at me reflect on myself, my family, my city What they say 'bout me reveal If my reputation would miss me What they see from me Would trickle down generations in time What they hear from me Would make 'em highlight my simplest lines  I'm talkin' fear, fear of losin' creativity I'm talkin' fear, fear of missin' out on you and me I'm talkin' fear, fear of losin' loyalty from pride 'Cause my DNA won't let me involve in the light of God I'm talkin' fear, fear that my humbleness is gone I'm talkin' fear, fear that love ain't livin' here no more I'm talkin' fear, fear that it's wickedness or weakness Fear, whatever it is, both is distinctive Fear, what happens on Earth stays on Earth And I can't take these feelings with me So hopefully they disperse Within fourteen tracks, carried out over wax Searchin' for resolutions until somebody get back Fear, what happens on Earth stays on Earth And I can't take these feelings with me So hopefully they disperse Within fourteen tracks, carried out over wax Wonderin' if I'm livin' through fear or livin' through rap  Damn Goddamn you Goddamn me Goddamn us Goddamn we Goddamn us all  Verse two says you only have I known of all the families of the Earth,  therefore I will punish you for all your iniquities.  So until we come back to these commandments,  until you come back to these commandments,  we're gonna feel this way, we're gonna be under this curse.  Because he said he's gonna punish us,  the so-called Blacks, Hispanics, and Native American Indians,  are the true children of Israel.  We are the Israelites according to the Bible.  The children of Israel, he's gonna punish us for our iniquities,  for our disobedience,  because we chose to follow other gods that aren't his son,  so the Lord, thy God, chasten thee.  So, just like you chasten your own son,  he's gonna chastise you because he loves you.  So that's why we get chastised,  that's why we're in the position we're in.  Until we come back to these laws, statutes and commandments,  and do what the Lord said, these curses are gonna be upon us.  We're gonna be at a lower state in this life that we live here in today,  in the United States of America.  I love you, son, and I pray for you.  God bless you, shalom.   ###############################################  This what God feel like, huh, yeah Laughin' to the bank like, "A-ha!", huh, yeah Flex on swole like, "A-ha!", huh, yeah You feel some type of way, then a-ha!
